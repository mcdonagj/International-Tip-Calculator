# International-Tip-Calculator
A Python program written to simplify currency conversions between established currencies. 

By using information from fixer.io, the program calculates a total for the user using the values taken from this database of information.

This program will be utilizing several libraries, like Requests, in the final version.

Ideas for this project that I'm researching or implementing:

    1. A local graphical user interface utilizing Tkinter.
        a. [WIP] Created a UserInterface class to start this functionality.

    2. A Flask web application hosted on a webserver within Amazon Web Services' Elastic Beanstalk.

Version: V3.0.
